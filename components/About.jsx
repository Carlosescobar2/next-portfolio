          <p className="py-2 text-gray-600">
            In 2020 I was attending Sacramento State for Business Information
            Systems. Due to Covid, I had extra time to find my true passion for
            web development. I watched many videos about the lives of software
            engineers and there came many perks. I started to teach myself
            simple HTML and fell in love. Little did I know that HTML isnâ€™t the
            best representation of a developer. Deciding that I needed some kind
            of guidance to lead me down the right path I set out to find a
            course.

            My journey began in the middle of 2021 when I attended DevMountain
            for a rigorous 4-month coding Bootcamp. While coding, I specialized
            in React, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. Although there were many
            stressful times I completed the course while building amazing
            connections. Fascinated by the intricacy of coding I wanted to learn
            much more. After Devmoutain I have spent time building personal
            projects, collaborating with my peers, testing new languages, and practicing future
            interview questions.
